# Weather Checker

Weather Checker is a lightweight Python-based system tray app that checks your local weather every 30 minutes and notifies you if rain is coming soon.  
It runs silently in the background with a tray icon and sends notifications so you never get caught in the rain!

## Getting an OpenWeather API Key

RainDetector requires an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data.

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Go to the API keys section of your account dashboard.
3. Copy your API key.

4. In the `raindetector.py` file, replace the `openWeatherAPIKey` variable with your own key (Line 27):

```python
openWeatherAPIKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```
